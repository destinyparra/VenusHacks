      <h2>🌟 Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Finding period products on campus shouldn't be a struggle or inaccessible. Too often, it's unclear which
        bathrooms have them available or where to even start looking. Zot Spot aims to increase accessibility and ease
        by helping you quickly locate free period products across campus – because no one should have to stress during
        their period. </p>

          <p>Zot Spot helps students at UC Irvine easily locate free period products across campus. By providing a
            simple, student-friendly web app, we take the guesswork out of finding accessible menstrual resources—so you
            can focus on what matters, not on searching bathroom to bathroom. </p>

        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>🤝 Community Driven</h3>
          <p>Zot Spot is built by students, for students. We believe in mutual care and collective empowerment, and we
            collaborate with campus organizations and student advocates to improve access, dignity, and support around
            menstrual health. </p>

          <h3>💡 Vision Forward</h3>
          <p> We envision a campus where no one is left scrambling for period products. Our goal is to expand to more
            universities, integrate real-time availability, and advocate for sustainable, stigma-free solutions—because
            period equity isn’t a luxury; it’s a right. </p>
